Premature optimisation is the root of all evil

So the rule is generally, write something that works, profile the code and improve the slow parts.
A better rule is, profile the code and improve the parts that need to be fast.
Profile the code and improve the parts that can be improved and need to be fast.

I think the "can be improved" part is rather important.
