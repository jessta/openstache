"In this essay, I argue that Lisp's expressive power is actually a cause of its lack of momentum."

In fact the expressive power of lisp is exactly why I've specifically avoided lisp.
Language design is hard, and easy to get wrong without realising. Many language features have great influent over the rest of the language, some features require other features
are impossible to have along side some others. A language that includes them all has in itself exclusive subsets. If you can't mix the features of a language together in the
same code base then it not a single languages at all.

Learning a language is hard too. Even formating of language makes it easier or harder to read depending on 
your previous experience.

The lispers say that lisp has every feature that any other language could have or could implement any feature in a short time. This is likely true, but any language is a
specific subset of all possible language features, paired down to a select few that are aggreed upon by the creators.

The concept that lisp is so expressive that 


Lisp is great when everything is lisp, but that's never the case and once you start including other languages in your system the advantages of lisp diminish.
