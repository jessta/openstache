"The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague."
- Edsger W. Dijkstra

I've always had an interest in computers. Starting off with some simple stuff and move to more and more things.
But I've always struggled. My biggest struggle is my need to try new things, old things are easy.

The software tools I use frustrate me. The massive complexity of the software I use everyday boggles the mind.
Understanding software often requires that you understand the minds of the programmers that wrote it.
