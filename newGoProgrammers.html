<h1>Things that new Go programmers tend to have trouble with</h1>
<p>
There are a few things that tend to come up on the mailing list often enough. They usually steam 
from people not reading the language spec and assuming that Go is the same as languages they've previously used.
These things all have simple rules and once you think about how else you could do these, you'll realise 
that out of the possible options these are a very good choice.<br />
The top 4:
<ul>
<li>The bracing style</li>
<li>Deleting items from maps</li>
<li>Implict convertions to interface types</li>
<li>Private fields in structs</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>The bracing style</h2>
<p>
Go has a required bracing style. This is a side-effect of the removal 
of the need for semicolons as statement seperators.

Interesting and possibly unexpected things happen if you don't follow this required style.
But it all follows a very simple rule.
'A newline will act as a statement terminator if the preceding statement is complete.'
(the actual rules are here, but the tend to confuse people
http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Semicolons)
</p>
<p>
So if you've got a complete statement all on one line then you don't have to worry about the terminator.
But if you're spliting a statement across multiple lines you have to make sure that each line isn't
 itself a complete statement.
</p>
<code>
//The following is a complete statement.
func myfunction(a int)
</code>
<p>
It's a function with an empty body. These are often used when you want 
to name a function that will be calling assembly code in a different file.
Most people aren't doing that, but it's still a valid statement.
</p>
If I was to do:
<code>
func myfunction(a int)
{
   fmt.Println("hello")
}
</code>
The parser would read the first line as a complete statement defining an empty 
function and then be confused by the '{' on the next line.

Why do it this way?
1. Having to put semicolons at the end of every statement is really annoying, especially when you miss one and have to
 go back and add it.
2. Once you remove the semicolon as a terminator you need some way to know that a statement has finished.
3. If you have to look ahead to the next line to know if the statement is complete or not then you can't make a REPL.
(Look at haskell's different syntax for it's REPL to see why looking-ahead to the next line is a terrible idea).



<h2>Deleting items from maps</h2>
<p>
This one bugged me for a while, it's simple and easy to remember but it's a bit 
weird in comparison to the rest of the language.
http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Map_types
</p>
But trying to think of a way to do this that fits in with the rest of the languages is harder than it seems at first.

Why did they do it this way?
1. having a del(),remove() etc. function that only dealt with maps would still be strange since 
it would only work on maps, and it would also be adding another function to the global scope, which is best to avoid.
2. code doesn't tend to remove things from maps all that often. So it's a rarely used function.



<h2>Implict convertions to interface types</h2>

When passing a value to a function that expects an interface type, the function will implicitly convert the value to an interface.
Everywhere else in the language conversions are required to be explicit.
I've noticed that this confuses people coming from c++ and Java because it confuses what an interface is in Go.

Unlike c++ and java, an interface in go is a run-time value that wraps another value, but if you don't care about 
the value contained in an interface and only the methods then you might not notice this and be confused when 
you finally do care about the value and it's not what you thought it was.

From the perspective of a java programmer it looks like you're just passing in a type that implements the 
interface and that type is what is available to the function being called.


Why did they do it this way?
The alternative is to require some kind of explicit conversion. This would get annoying very quickly because 
you'd almost always have to do the conversion between a type and an interface. It would make code that uses interfaces
a pain to work with and hide the real meaning with a lot of type conversions.
eg.
<code>
IsNil := func(x interface{}) bool { return x == nil }
IsNil(interface{}(nil))
</code>
But this isn't even right, since interface{}(nil) is kind of ambiguous, am I creating an interface{} that is nil or am I wrapping a nil value in an interface{}?



Which is more obvious, but makes using interfaces a real pain since you'd need to do a conversion every time you used an interface, making interfaces greatly annoying to use.

It's a simple rule, and once you know it it's not confusing at all.
Go has a few things that are a bit strange for people coming from other languages, but they are always simple rules that you'll never forget once you know them.
