The obvious simple learning project

I've learned a lot of programming languages. Most with different paradgims and different cultures with a different
way of doing things.
To learn these languages I'll generally start with some simple project, often it will be something I've done before, 
so I'm familiar with it. It also gives me a great way to see the difference between this new language and
 the previously lanauges I've written in.

This works well for languages that follow a simliar paradgim that have very similar semantic details.
When I got to langauges like haskell this method completely broke down.

In 'imperative languages' I'd always start with a simple program, that took some input, processed it in some way and output something.
Since most projects I do are pretty much that, this always gives a good feel for a language.

The biggest barrier people come across when trying to learn haskell is the 'monad'. It's also the first thing you encounter when you try
to do this kind of 'simple learning project' in haskell.
The first few times I tried to learn haskell this completely scared me away. If doing such a 'simple' thing was so difficult then 
how was I ever going to understand the rest of the language?

Eventually I went back and tried again, I skipped over the IO stuff and looked at the rest of the language.
