The More Things Change...
"everything moves in painful cycles of forgetting and reinvention in the computer industry"

My opinion on why this happens is all about problems and their solutions.
Problems always come before solutions, if you don't have the problem then you won't think about or learn about a solution.
"Of course, this is how it ever was; lessons learned in mainframes being forgotten and re-learned by the upstart minicomputer folks, and then in turn forgotten and re-learned in the age of the microprocessor, and now once again in the age of web development"

In this case, 

Web development became quite popluar. 
Even now if you ask a web developer about making user interfaces they will tell you that making user interfaces for the web is far eaiser than the usual graphical tookits(QT,GTK, etc.).



Why this happens


We're all building mainframes again. Because centralised computing is cheap to run.
Distributed computing is still taking a back seat.
